Application issues
- Email Task Queue
- Mail server blocking connections due to restrictions or limitations (https://github.com/mattupstate/flask-mail/issues/93)
- Regarding the load times of the password reset feature, I am still noticing a small difference in speed after implementing the asynchronous send-method. This opens up our young web app for timing attacks, even though we only return a single message saying "check your email".
An easy suggestion of how to fix this would be to start a new thread in both cases, when the email exists among our users and when it doesn't and let the thread figure out whether to send the mail or not.


Implementations
- Email when registered
- Confirmation email/Block access until Confirmation
- Revoke previous Password Reset Request tokens
